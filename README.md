# SQL- EMPLOYEE DATABASE
## BACKGROUND
It’s a beautiful spring day, and it’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

You will perform:

  1. Data Modeling
  2. Data Engineering
  3. Data Analysis

#### Data Modeling
Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables by using the tool like http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com.
